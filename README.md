# DogFeederGame 🐶

A small desktop game built in **Unity** with **C#** as part of the *Unity Learn – Junior Programmer* pathway.  
The goal is simple: feed the dog by launching food while managing timing, position, and basic physics.

This project focuses on core gameplay programming fundamentals rather than art or polish.

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals

DogFeederGame was built to practice:

- Writing gameplay logic in **C#** (update loops, methods, variables, conditions)
- Handling **player input** and mapping it to in-game actions
- Working with **Rigidbody** / basic physics and simple collision detection
- Managing **game state** (start, playing, success/fail conditions)
- Structuring scripts and prefabs in a clean, reusable way

---

## 🕹️ Gameplay Overview

- The player triggers a mechanism to launch food toward the dog.
- The aim is to time and position the launch so the food reaches the dogs.
- Difficulty comes from timing and simple level variations(spawn speed increase).

---

## 🎮 Controls

- **Space / Mouse Click** – Trigger the food launch
- **Left/Right/Up/Down** or **A/D/W/S** - for player movement
- **Esc** – Quit / return to menu

---

## 🧱 Features

- Built entirely in **C#** using Unity’s component-based architecture  
- Simple **2D/3D physics interactions** for food launching and landing  
- **Collision logic** to detect when food reaches the bowl or misses  
- Basic **UI feedback** (win/lose text, score bar)  
- Clean separation between **input**, **gameplay logic**, and **visuals**

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Engine:** Unity
- **Language:** C#  
- **Target Platform:** Desktop (Windows/macOS)
